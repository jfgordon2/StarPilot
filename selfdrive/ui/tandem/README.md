# Tandem

Tandem is this fork of StarPilot. Its design language is **Essentials**: fewer choices and better defaults, with the car explaining what it's doing. This package holds the Essentials component library. The mocks, screenshots and tokens are in [`design/`](design/). It's built on raylib and the existing `Widget` base class. Screens are put together from these pieces instead of drawing with raylib directly.

| Module | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `fonts.py` | `font(face)`: the shared `FontWeight` faces from `gui_app`, plus `ExtraFont.EXTRA_BOLD` and `ExtraFont.MONO`, which load on first use. |
| `tokens.py` | Colors, type sizes, radii, layout sizes and timings in device pixels. `px()` converts mock pixels and `font_px()` converts mock font sizes. |
| `layout.py` | Rectangle math: `row`, `column`, `grid` (fixed sizes plus `FILL`), `inset`, `place`, `grow`. It doesn't draw. |
| `draw.py` | Rounded fills, single-line text (aligned and elided), captions, wrapped paragraphs, and `icon()`, which draws the mocks' line icons tinted (chevron, cross, plus and check use them too). |
| `icons/` | The mocks' icons: `svg/` holds each one copied from the mocks, and the PNGs beside it are rasterized from them by `tools/build_icons.js` (`node tools/build_icons.js`, needs Playwright's Chromium). Add an icon by adding its SVG and rerunning the tool. |
| `base.py` | `Component`: a `Widget` with `preferred_size()`, plus a touch area grown to `MIN_TOUCH`. `resolve()` for values that may be getters. |
| `controls.py` | `Button` (primary, secondary, ghost, danger for a confirm, danger soft for every other destructive button, nav), `ButtonRow`, `ValueButton`, `ToggleButton`, `Switch`, `Segmented`, `ChoiceCards`, `Stepper`, `Slider`, `Badge`, `Chip`, `ProgressBar` |
| `rows.py` | `SettingRow`, `SectionHeader`, `Text`, `Banner`, `OptionList` (pick one from a list), `Padded`, and `ListPanel`, which stacks rows with dividers, scrolls when they overflow, and can pin a footer |
| `chrome.py` | `BottomNav`, `Sidebar`, `PageHeader`, `HubTile`, `HubGrid`, and `SettingsPage`, which assembles a full screen |
| `assets/` | `boot_logo.jpg`, Tandem's boot logo (2160×1080, from `boot_logo.html`). Choosing it copies the file into StarPilot's boot logos folder, where StarPilot's theme manager installs it like any other logo; the Essentials defaults choose it. |
| `blocks.py` | Layout blocks for the mocks' card layouts: `Stack` (with `SPACER`s or a growing item), `Card`, `Columns`, `Grid`, `Label`, `ValueLine`, `IconTitle`, `InfoCard`, `Field`, `Icon`, `Inline`, `Sized`, `Surface` |
| `overlays.py` | `Sheet` (slides up), `Dialog` (confirm; `Tone.DANGER` gives a destructive button), `Toast` |
| Settings › Device › Developer (`settings/developer.py`) | openpilot's Developer panel in our rows: ADB, SSH, GitHub SSH keys (upstream's fetcher), joystick debug, alpha longitudinal (with our warning, only where offered) and UI debug. |
| More for your car (`settings/vehicle.py`) | StarPilot's car-specific options for the detected car, on its params and handlers; restarts and panda flashing ask first in our dialogs. |
| `overlays.py` dialogs over upstream actions | Restart, Power Off, Recalibrate and the driver monitoring reset ask in our `Dialog`, then run upstream's action (the confirm-only prompts are run with their dialog caught and answered, so upstream's checks still apply). Software's Release Channel and Uninstall (upstream's three steps), What's new and the Bluetooth sound test use our sheets and dialogs too. How It Works stays upstream's training guide: its steps are pre-drawn images. |
| `keyboard.py` | `EssentialsKeyboard`: upstream's `Keyboard` (typing, shift and caps, the 123 and #+= layers, backspace repeat, password masking, minimum length) drawn as `design/keyboard.html`, with a named action key. Used by every text entry our screens open: Wi-Fi and hotspot passwords, APN, Report a Problem, the startup message and the Galaxy password. Destination search holds it in the page as a `KeyPad`. |

## Building a screen

The param names below are made up to keep the example short; `settings/` has the real screens.

```python
from openpilot.selfdrive.ui.tandem import (BottomNav, ListPanel, Segmented, SettingRow, SettingsPage, Sidebar, SidebarItem, Stepper,
                                               Switch)

params = Params()

page = SettingsPage(
  sidebar=Sidebar("Driving", [SidebarItem("Everyday"), SidebarItem("Weather", open_weather, value="Auto")], selected=0),
  content=ListPanel([
    SettingRow("Driving Style", "Sets following gap, acceleration and braking together",
               Segmented(["Relaxed", "Standard", "Sport"], lambda: params.get_int("DrivingStyle"),
                         lambda i: params.put_int("DrivingStyle", i))),
    SettingRow("Offset", "Added to every matched limit",
               Stepper(lambda: params.get_int("SpeedLimitOffset"), lambda v: params.put_int("SpeedLimitOffset", int(v)), -10, 15,
                       fmt=lambda v: f"{v:+g} mph"), indent=True),
    SettingRow("Smart Slowdowns", "Slows for curves and stop lights", Switch(lambda: params.get_bool("SmartSlowdowns"),
                                                                             lambda on: params.put_bool("SmartSlowdowns", on))),
  ], title="Everyday"),
  nav=BottomNav(["Driving", "Device", "Network", "Bluetooth", "Software"], selected=0, on_select=open_tab),
)
```

## Conventions

- **Values may be getters.** Any `Bindable` argument takes either a plain value or a zero-argument callable that is read every frame. That lets a row stay in sync with Params without extra glue. Changes go out through `on_change` / `on_click` callbacks.
- **Containers lay out their children.** A container asks each child for `preferred_size(max_width)` and decides where it goes, so pages never hard-code positions.
- **Touch.** A control smaller than `MIN_TOUCH` (112 px) still responds across a 112 px area. Containers turn that off with `grow_touch_target = False`. Rows inside a `ListPanel` ignore taps that are really scrolls.
- **Color and size only come from `tokens`.** If a screen needs a value that isn't there, add a token rather than a hex code.
- **Text.** Use `draw.text`, `draw.caption` and `draw.paragraph`. They apply `FONT_SCALE` and elide with "…". The font atlases are pre-baked, so a character that isn't baked in draws as "?". Add it to `DESIGN_CHARS` in `tools/build_figtree_fonts.py` and run that script.

## Keeping rebases easy

Automatic crash and performance reporting is disabled by the fork-owned `starpilot/tandem/diagnostics.py`. Exceptions, stall dumps and native crash artifacts remain on the device; unattended Sentry events, remote diagnostic log/stat forwarding and StarPilot statistics uploads are blocked. Sentry only sends explicitly submitted issue reports and tunes, with automatic integrations, sessions and tracing disabled. The drive-log/video Uploads setting is separate and keeps its existing behavior. Base-code integrations are small policy hooks so rebases can keep upstream's capture and upload logic.

This fork is rebased onto StarPilot, and everything outside this package belongs to StarPilot or to openpilot underneath it. Our work therefore lives in new files and edits upstream files only when there is no other way.

- **Ours:** everything in `selfdrive/ui/tandem/`, meaning the code, `design/` (mocks and docs), `tools/` and `tests/`. Also the new font files `selfdrive/assets/fonts/Figtree-*` and `Figtree-OFL.txt`, which have to sit where the app loads fonts from.
- **Upstream integration:**
  - The file names in `FontWeight` (`system/ui/lib/application.py`), which switch the whole UI to Figtree.
  - In `selfdrive/ui/layouts/main.py`: the imports, the calls that create the sidebar, home, settings and onroad screens (`screens.py`), and the left sidebar's width. StarPilot's developer sidebar on the right keeps upstream's width.
  - In the wheel controls daemon and its manager predicate: temporary button testing runs while the Bluetooth screen is open, including onroad, without changing the saved enable setting. Tests cover the service and screen lifecycle.
  - Small hooks: `_show_header()` in `selfdrive/ui/layouts/home.py`, a lane line color override in `selfdrive/ui/onroad/model_renderer.py`, `_get_border_color()` in `selfdrive/ui/onroad/starpilot/starpilot_onroad_view.py`, and the Help steer sound in `selfdrive/ui/soundd.py`.
  - `common/params_keys.h`: `SteeringHeadroomWarning` and `DeveloperStripMetrics`.
  - `system/version.py`: `release` is in `RELEASE_BRANCHES`, so Tandem's release branch boots as a release build (development-only params cleared, friendly update errors).

  If a rebase conflicts in these files, keep upstream's version and reapply the integration.
- **Unchanged:** `Widget`, `process.py`, the installer, the Inter and mono files, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and the upstream settings panels.
- **New needs go in this package**, not in shared modules. For example, extra font faces live in `fonts.py` rather than in `FontWeight`.

## Branches and merging upstream

Tandem has one branch, `release`, on `jfgordon2/StarPilot`. Upstream is StarPilot's `StarPilot` branch on `StarPilotHQ/StarPilot` (firestar5683's repo), which sits on openpilot. Tandem merges upstream rather than rebasing, so `release` keeps its history and pushes never need force.

Set up once in a clone:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/StarPilotHQ/StarPilot.git
```

To take upstream's changes:

```
git checkout release
git fetch upstream StarPilot
git merge upstream/StarPilot
```

Conflicts can only come from the upstream files listed under Upstream integration, and from the owner's own changes to StarPilot code (the turn signal animations in `selfdrive/ui/onroad/starpilot/turn_signals.py` and `starpilot/assets/signal_packs/`, the settings it adds, and the diagnostics hooks). Keep upstream's version, then make our edit again. Files in this package never conflict.

After a merge, check what Tandem reads from StarPilot, which can change without a conflict:
- run the tests in `tests/` (see the top of this README);
- the turn signal renderer's `render()` arguments and `BUNDLED_SIGNAL_PATHS` (`onroad/view.py`, `settings/display.py`);
- the messages and fields the status chips read (`onroad/status.py`) and the alert names in `onroad/alerts.py`;
- `RELEASE_BRANCHES` still lists `release`.

## The settings window

`settings/` is the Essentials settings window. `selfdrive/ui/layouts/main.py` creates it through `settings_window()` instead of upstream's `SettingsLayout`. Set `TANDEM_SETTINGS=0` to get the upstream window back.

### How it's built

- **Window:** `window.py` has five tabs, each with its own page stack, and the close/back button. It also takes upstream `PanelType`s, so the home screen and sidebar open the right tab. Sheets and dialogs are drawn over the page by the window itself (`present`/`dismiss`), because the app draws only the top widget of its own stack.
- **Models and panels:** each screen is a small model class that reads and writes params through `SettingsStore`, plus a function that builds its panel. One control usually writes several params, and the model owns that mapping. Tests drive the models with a fake param cache.
- **Upstream logic:** anything with real logic behind it goes through an adapter class named `Upstream…` that calls upstream code. That covers downloads, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, wheel remotes, the updater, the car list, and calibration and power. Upstream keeps its checks, threads and confirmations, and we only draw. The window takes each adapter as a constructor argument, so tests and headless renders pass fakes (`tests/fakes.py`).
- **Signalling:** `SettingsStore.write` signals the driving processes once per call. `SettingsStore.batch()` groups many writes into one signal; Reset Settings uses it.

| Tab | Screens | Files | Upstream code it drives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Driving | Hub with the power-user switches | `driving_tab.py`, `bundles.py` | |
| | Speed & Steering: Everyday, Vehicle Profile, Weather, Navigation, Assistance | `speed_steering.py` | |
| | Display: Driving Screen, Theme & Startup, Map | `display.py` | |
| | Alerts, with the volume sheet | `alerts.py` | Sounds screen's sample player |
| | Driving Model and its catalog | `model.py` | Driving model screen controller |
| | Vehicle and the car picker | `vehicle.py` | Fingerprint catalog, button actions |
| | Offline Maps and the region picker | `maps.py` | Maps screen controller; removal is StarPilot's (parked, not mid-download), confirmed in our dialog |
| | Tuner Mode: Steering, Gas & Brake, Following & Stops, Bundle Overrides | `tuner.py`, `editors.py` | |
| Device | This Device, the pairing page, Remote Access, Regulatory and the driver camera (`drivercamera.py`) | `device.py` | `DeviceLayout` handlers; the pairing code is upstream's `PairingDialog`'s (token and 5-minute refresh). Remote Access uses upstream's Galaxy keyboard, files, link and `GalaxyQRDialog` code, and its unpair; the password setup writes the same three files upstream's handler does, without its QR dialog |
| | General, Backups, Storage & Data, Report a Problem | `device_sections.py` | Same folders and report as StarPilot's System screen; one storage measurement shared with Offline Maps and the model catalog; offline maps and unused models can also be removed here |
| Network | Wi-Fi, Cellular, and Roaming, APN and IP address | `network_tab.py` | `WifiManager` |
| Bluetooth | Wheel Buttons, car audio, nearby devices | `bluetooth_tab.py` | Wheel controls service, `BluetoothManager` |
| Software | Updates, release channel, Reset Settings, Uninstall | `software_tab.py`, `defaults.py` | `SoftwareLayout` actions |

### Upstream screens still shown, one tap away

These are reached from a row or button, never as a tab:

- **Destination search**, from Navigation's Set or Change. In the mocks it belongs on the parked home screen, which isn't built yet.
- **"More for your car"** under Vehicle. It holds car-specific toggles (Toyota, Subaru, Bolt, Jeep) and panda flashing.
- **openpilot's Developer panel**, under Device, only while Tuner Mode is on.

`upstream.py` hosts them. `StarPilotPage` opens one StarPilot panel directly, without going through StarPilot's own hub.

### Where the code differs from the mocks

- **Alerts:** the volume preset adds **Auto**, upstream's default, where the level follows cabin noise.
- **Uploads:** offers Off, **Parked** and Always. Upstream can hold uploads while driving, but it has no Wi-Fi-only switch.
- **Things upstream has no support for:**
  - Automatic weekly backups.
  - "Attach last drive" in Report a Problem.
  - Automatic matching of the speed limit sign style to your region, so the choice is US or Vienna.
- **Wheel remotes** don't come with four preset buttons. A button has to be pressed before it can be mapped.
- **Wheel-button testing** captures remote presses while the Bluetooth tab is shown, including onroad and with no mappings yet. Leaving the tab or closing settings ends testing and cancels pending learning. Testing does not change the saved enable setting for normal remote actions.
- **Button favorites** run the existing settings/action favorites. Car and remote pickers show each saved action's name; these are separate from saved destinations. Removing or moving a remote mapping frees its controller action slot once no other button uses it.
- **openpilot's core switches** live in Speed & Steering › Assistance. Upstream's "Experimental mode" switch is gone; Smart Slowdowns switches modes automatically.

## Onroad, home and first-run setup

`screens.py` creates the screens MainLayout shows. Setting `TANDEM_SIDEBAR=0`, `TANDEM_HOME=0`, `TANDEM_SETTINGS=0` or `TANDEM_ONROAD=0` brings back upstream's version of that screen.

- **Onroad** (`onroad/`): `EssentialsOnroadView` subclasses StarPilot's onroad view and keeps its camera, path and lane lines, and StarPilot still chooses every alert. It replaces the following:
  - **Bottom bar:** a scrim, not a panel. It holds menu (the sidebar), MAX − / + (StarPilot's `SLCForceCruiseSpeed`, only while engaged), the street name, and engage.
    - Engage and disengage go through the wheel controls' action counters.
    - While a route is active, the street name gives way to arrival time, what's left and End route. That reads `navInstruction` through the view's own subscriber, since `ui_state` doesn't subscribe to it.
  - **Status chips** (bottom left, stacked up from the bar): up to four at once, newest nearest the bar (the highest priority when there are more); each held 2 s after its reason ends, renewed when it fires again, then faded, with the rest sliding down; all hidden during alerts (`ChipStack`). The rules are in `onroad/status.py`, pure and tested.
    - Turn progress uses the planner's active turn-speed target and measured deceleration for "Slowing for turn", then its turn events for "Turning left/right". Slowing stays first during the approach, even if the model has already requested the turn. Steering, stopping and curve statuses keep their existing priority.
    - "Turning left/right" also appears directly when there was no automatic slowdown, including Always On Steering with the driver operating gas/brake, with or without a route.
    - The slowdown chip and navigation card share maneuver icons. The chip uses the turn that actually set the speed target (including a next turn), with a neutral map icon if the direction is unknown. Paused-steering chevrons follow the signal side, with a hazard symbol for both signals. Weather chips use rain, snow or fog icons to match the condition.
    - Lane-change and turn progress always use chips. Display's Driving Style Banner switch only controls the personality message when the style changes (off by default), using the existing saved preference. There is no Clean Screen bundle in Tuner Mode.
  - **Steering headroom arc:** replaces the torque bar and uses its estimate. It has three stages (under 60%, 60–85%, over 85% held for 0.5 s) and a faint preview of what the path needs 2.5 s ahead.
    - At limit, the lane lines turn orange, the border turns amber, and Help steer plays one soft warning chime through soundd. It uses the warning volume and steering-limit mute-speed settings. The warning clears below 80%, or when steering becomes inactive; existing alerts take priority. The small release margin prevents repeated chimes around 85%.
  - **New-limit card:** asks before matching a higher limit. Match sends StarPilot's `SpeedLimitAccepted`. Ignore suppresses consecutive offers for that same limit, including after an offer expires or its source briefly disappears. An intervening higher or lower posted limit, or a new drive, allows it again.
  - **Speed, sign and turn card:** StarPilot still decides when each shows (its HUD's speed with the hide-speed rule, its speed card's posted limit, its turn card's route data); they're drawn as in the mocks. The sign stays top left, with the turn card popping up below it while navigating; while the new-limit card asks it takes the sign's place, and the turn card stays below it. The compass above the speed isn't drawn.
  - **Turn signal:** two green chevrons in the speed pill on the signalling side, the brighter one stepping outward. It replaces StarPilot's signal animations, so Display has no animation picker.
  - **Removed:** the driving personality button, the experimental-mode wheel, the favorites menu (the lower-left gesture), the picture-in-picture side camera (a Galaxy developer feature), the stopped timer, and the paused and weather badges, which the chips replace.
  - **Alerts** (`onroad/alerts.py`): StarPilot's alert renderer keeps its choice of alert, timing, sound and fades; the drawing follows the three levels in `design/alertstyles.html`. Info (normal and StarPilot alerts) is a dark pill at the bottom and the border keeps its color. Warning (prompts) is an amber two-line card with an amber border. Critical (full-screen or critical alerts) is a dark red takeover with a steering wheel icon and a red border, and the sign hides under it. Reverse gear keeps StarPilot's text-only drawing over the rear view. Light Turned Green, Lead Departed, lane changes and turn progress show as status chips instead of banners; their chime still plays and the bar stays usable. The bar, chip, new-limit card and driver monitor tile hide during any other alert.
  - **Driver monitor** (top right corner): upstream's driver state drawn as a dark tile with the driver icon, ringed green while attentive and amber as attention drops, dimmed when the camera isn't monitoring, hidden during alerts as upstream does.
- **Where to?** (`destinations.py`, mocks `destinations.html`, `navsearch.html`, `routepreview.html`): one full-screen widget with three views, opened from Home and from Settings › Navigation. StarPilot's navigation controller still does the work (Mapbox search and resolving, favorites with Home and Work, recents, starting and ending a route); `UpstreamPlaces` reaches into it. The route preview (`routemap.py`) asks Mapbox for the route the way navigationd does (`MapboxRouteEngine`, `MapboxSecretKey` and the last GPS fix), in the background, and draws it on the mock's stylized map with Arrive, Time and Distance. There are no map tiles; the route is fitted to the panel, north up. This is one extra directions request per previewed place, before navigationd makes its own on Start.
  - The list: Home and Work tiles (a tile with nothing saved searches for one and sets it), Add favorite, other favorites, recents with a star, and the active route with End route. Offline maps ready shows when maps are downloaded.
  - Search: the keyboard sits in the page; results update 0.6 s after you stop typing (from 3 letters), and Search lists them all without the keyboard.
  - The preview: the place, what Essentials does on the way, and Favorite / Home / Work toggles, then Start. There is no map or arrival estimate before starting: StarPilot only routes once a destination is set. Renaming a favorite isn't offered.
- **Home's alerts and update** (`home_alerts.py`, `design/homealerts.html`, `homeupdate.html`): upstream's OffroadAlert and UpdateAlert still read the params and own Snooze update, Acknowledge excessive actuation and Reboot and update; we draw alert cards by severity (with short titles for the alerts we know) and the release notes, and Home no longer shows upstream's header.
- **Home** (`home.py`): upstream's HomeLayout with new home content: readiness and the current setup, Where to? (`destinations.py`), and update status. The home cards use the full content height without the legacy header or its tap targets. Offroad alerts and update details retain upstream's header and navigation.
- **Sidebar** (`sidebar.py`): subclasses upstream's Sidebar, which still tracks device state and owns the callbacks. It has a Settings button and a status card with Network, comma connect, Temperature, Vehicle and Maps, each with a colored dot. Onroad it adds Save a clip (upstream's flag button), and it shows a recording indicator while cabin audio is recorded.
- **First-run setup** (`setup.py`): three questions, or Use defaults. Either way it applies the Essentials defaults first. Home shows it once, as soon as onboarding has closed; a marker file beside the params folder records that it's done, so no new param key is needed.

What these don't do yet:
- **Onroad extras** (`onroad/extras.py`, `design/onroadextras.html`): StarPilot's optional visuals, each still under its own switch, drawn in Essentials: pedal tiles (PedalsOnUI) and the external-GPU model chip under the driver monitor tile (StarPilot's widget still decides the state and fade), the compass as a tag beside the street name, a stopping-point line with a distance tag, adjacent-lane and blind-spot washes, light-blue path edges, white radar dots, the curve glow in our blue, and signal (blue, blinking) and blind-spot (red) halves of the border. StarPilot's steering-torque border fill is left out; the steering arc shows the same. The rainbow path stays StarPilot's.
- **Developer View** (`onroad/developer.py`, `design/onroaddev.html`), in JetBrains Mono as the mock sets it: a panel on the right with LEAD (distance, gap, relative speed, radar or vision), DEVICE (CPU and temperature, GPU, RAM, FPS) and CONTROLS (curve speed, limit source, lane widths); a strip above the bar; Lead Insights' tag above the lead car; and the limit's source and offset under the sign. Values come from openpilot's and StarPilot's messages (`read()`). StarPilot's settings decide what shows: its developer sidebar switch for the panel, Developer UI for the rest, and each row's own switch (ShowCPU, NumericalTemp, ShowGPU, ShowMemoryUsage, FPSCounter, AdjacentPathMetrics, SpeedLimitSources; the last also covers the note under the sign), all in Tuner › Bundle Overrides. The strip shows up to five metrics picked there under Bar metrics (`STRIP_METRICS`, kept in the new `DeveloperStripMetrics` param, default the mock's accel, want, jerk, lat and delay), each given an equal share of the width; picking none hides it. `main.py` takes the panel and its width from `screens.py`.
